# Javascript Sudoku
## Author: Bice

## Introduction

I wrote the original version of this in total isolation with no access to the internet or any research materials.
I had to reverse engineer a system for building puzzles according to a specified difficulty level. So not only did
I have to solve how Sudoku is made, I also had to figure out how to program it.

### v0 

Built v0 on paper, you can see the photos below

### v1

I was unable to keep a digital copy of the original code, so I hand recorded it as best I could onto notebook paper.
This code is no longer functioning properly and I may never walk back through it, it did in it's original form function 
as expected.

### v2

Attempting to keep as much of the original form, I did not want to dramatically change the architecture of the original
program. Primarily, I have cleaned up the code and implemented a more modern standard using HTML5(Flexbox), ES6, as well
as clean up of comments, naming conventions, implementation of file separations utilizing imports/exports.

### v3

Future overhaul to take place at some as yet unknown date.
